Here's a README file for the read_a_sentence algorithm:

Read A Sentence Algorithm
This algorithm processes a given sentence and performs the following tasks:

Computes the length of the sentence.
Counts the number of words in the sentence.
Counts the number of vowels in the sentence.

Description
Variables
sentence: A string that stores the input sentence.
sentence_length: An integer that stores the length of the sentence.
spaces_count: An integer that counts the number of spaces in the sentence to help calculate the number of words.
word_count: An integer that stores the number of words in the sentence.
vowel_count: An integer that counts the number of vowels in the sentence.
Steps
Read Input Sentence: The algorithm starts by reading an input sentence.
Calculate Sentence Length: The length of the sentence is calculated using the length property of the string.
Count Words: By iterating through the sentence and counting spaces, the algorithm determines the number of words. Each space signifies a new word, so the word count is spaces_count + 1.
Count Vowels: The algorithm iterates through each character in the sentence and increments the vowel_count for every vowel found (a, e, i, o, u).
Output Results: Finally, the algorithm prints the sentence length, the word count, and the vowel count.
Assumptions
Words in the sentence are separated by a single space.
The sentence does not start or end with a space.
The algorithm only counts lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
Example
For the sentence "hello world", the output will be:

sentence_length: 11
word_count: 2
vowel_count: 3
Notes
The algorithm currently handles only lowercase vowels. To handle uppercase vowels, the condition in the vowel-counting loop should be updated.
This algorithm does not account for punctuation or special characters. If these are present, the logic might need adjustments.
